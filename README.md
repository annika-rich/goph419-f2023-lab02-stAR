# Lab02 GOPH 419 - Computational Methods for Geophysicists
*Semester:* F2023

*Instructor:* B. Karchewski

*Author:* Annika Richardson

The purpose of this lab is to examine algorithms for solving linear systems of equations and using spline interpolation between discrete data points.

To use the code developed in this repository, refer to the requirements.txt file and install the listed package dependencies with the command:

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

The local *lab02* developed during this lab will also need to be installed in developer mode in the virtual environment used to run this code. To install the local python package use the following command:

    pip install -e ./

The driver script for the functions developed in this repository can be found in examples/driver.py. The functions can be found in src/lab02/linalg_interp.py. Figures generated by the driver.py file can be found in figures/.
